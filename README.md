This is a simple Django REST framework project with user authentication, event creation. It provides a basic CRUD operations.

## Features:

- User registration and JWT-based authentication.
- Event management with the ability to create, update, delete events.
- Filtering and search events.

## Requirements:

- Python
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- Simple JWT
- PostgreSQL


## Using Docker:

Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/barabarinov/RESTful-events-api.git
   ```

Run the following command to prepare your environment for the first run:
```shell
make prepare
```

Build and start the application using Docker:
```shell
make up
```

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/:

Use the default credentials to log in:
- **Username:** admin
- **Password:** admin

If needed, you can update these credentials in the .env file before starting the containers.

To stop the running containers, use:
```shell
make down
```

To remove all containers, images, and volumes, use:
```shell
make clean
```

### Additional Notes:
- Make sure you have Docker installed and running before you start.
- The app will automatically create an admin user the first time you run it. If an admin already exists, it will skip this step and let you know.
- Static files are automatically collected during the Docker build process (python manage.py collectstatic). No additional actions are required.
