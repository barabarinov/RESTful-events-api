This is a simple Django REST framework project with user authentication, event creation. It provides a basic CRUD operations.

## Features

- **User registration** and JWT-based authentication.
- **Event management** with the ability to create, update, delete events.
- **Event management** with the ability to filtering and search events.

## Requirements

- Python
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- Simple JWT
- PostgreSQL


## Using Docker

Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/barabarinov/RESTful-events-api.git
   ```

Run the following command to rename `.env.example` to `.env`:
```shell
make prepare
```

Build and start the application using Docker:
```shell
make up
```

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/:

Use the default credentials to log in:
- **Username:** admin
- **Password:** admin

If needed, you can update these credentials in the .env file before starting the containers.

To stop the running containers, use:
```shell
make down
```

To remove all containers, images, and volumes, use:
```shell
make clean
```

Additional Notes:
- Ensure Docker Desktop (or an equivalent Docker environment) is installed and running before executing these steps.
- During the initial startup, the script automatically creates a superuser if it doesn’t already exist. If a superuser already exists, the script will skip this step with a message.
- Static files are automatically collected during the Docker build process (python manage.py collectstatic). No additional actions are required.
